"""
Every built-in profile, on whatever GPU is present.

`METRIC_PROFILES` is declared once for all architectures, but metric coverage
varies: the CDNA-only entries in `memory` have no counterpart on RDNA. A
profile must therefore either collect the metrics this architecture supports,
or fail with a message naming the architecture — never crash on a metric the
backend has never heard of.

Deliberately not gated on a single architecture. The absence of an
architecture-generic profile test is why `memory`, `memory_cache`, and
`compute` shipped broken on every RDNA part.
